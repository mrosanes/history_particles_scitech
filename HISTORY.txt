TECHNOLOGY (MACHINES + Science)
-------------------------------

- CYCLOTRON (1932): spiral accelerator of charged particles with target (medical applications, new materials)
- KLYSTRON (1936): linear accelerator
- SYNCHROCYCLOTRON (1946): medical applications + new materials -> charged particles on targets (cyclortron + variable frequency)
- SYNCHROTRON (1948-1949): produce light in different EM regions
- CERN IDEA IS BORN (1949)
- TOKAMAK (1950): fusion reactor idea and design
- STELLATOR (1950): fusion reactor idea and design
- CERN CONSTRUCTION BEGINS (1954)
- COLLIDERS (1960): are a type of synchrotrons and use its technology to accelerate particles.
- GYROTRON (1963): produce sub-millimeter wavelength radiation to inject energy
- INTERNET (1960): MIT Internet articles (1961 first studies about packet commutation) (1969 ARPANET first packets) (1983 adopts TCP/IP)
- CERN FIRST COLLISION (1971)
- WWW World Wide Web IS BORN AT CERN (1990)
- JET TOKAMAK (1991): first controlled reaction at JET
